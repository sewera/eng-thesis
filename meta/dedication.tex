  To all the people who told me\\
  to get to work when I needed it,\\
  critiqued me in what I could improve,\\
  made me coffee, tea, food,\\
  and generally made me a happier person.

  \vspace*{\baselineskip}
  Anything I am now proud of\\
  would not be possible without your support.

  \vspace*{\baselineskip}
  Thank you.
