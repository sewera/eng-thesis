\abstract
Notipie is a notification system,
ultimately aiming at unifying
different notification standards,
providing user with a single source of truth
for their notifications,
and eliminating the need
for the troublesome e-mail notifications.
The overall goal of this project
was to create a full-stack application
that can produce notifications using a certain protocol
and present them to the user
with a web-based graphical user interface.
The challenges this project posed include,
inter alia,
the use of the latest web technologies,
deep understanding of backend development in Go language,
and project management.
