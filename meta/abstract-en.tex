\abstract
Notipie is a notification system,
ultimately aiming at unifying
different notification standards,
providing its users with a single source of truth
for their notifications,
and eliminating the need
for the troublesome e-mail notifications.
The overall goal of this project
was to create a full-stack application
that can present the notifications to the user
with a web-based graphical user interface,
and a library
for simple notification creation.
The challenges this project posed include,
inter alia,
the use of the latest web technologies,
deep understanding of backend development in Go language,
and project management.
