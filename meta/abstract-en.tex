\abstract
Notipie is a notification system,
ultimately aiming at unifying
different notification standards,
providing its users with a single source of truth
for their notifications,
and eliminating the need
for the troublesome e-mail notifications.
The overall goal of this project
was to create a full-stack application
that can present the notifications to the user
with a web-based graphical user interface,
and a library
for simple notification creation.
The challenges this project posed include,
inter alia,
the use of the latest web technologies,
deep understanding of~backend development in Go language,
and project management.
