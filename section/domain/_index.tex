\section{Domain}\label{sec:domain}

I started tackling the problem domain with laying out
the high-level definitions of all significant parts
that are necessary for implementing the solution.
I wanted the domain of my application
to be as simple and clear as possible.
Therefore,
I came up with
\iac{UL}~\cite{evans_domain-driven_2003,millett_patterns_2015},
and defined four main components: Notification, Tag, App, and User.

\input{section/domain/notification.tex}
\input{section/domain/tag.tex}
\input{section/domain/app.tex}
\input{section/domain/user.tex}
