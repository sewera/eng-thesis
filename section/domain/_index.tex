\section{Domain}\label{sec:domain}

\Ac{DDD} is a software design approach
that aligns the code with the reality
of the problem domain.
It achieves said alignment by targeting
the following components of the problem domain:
its terminology,
the core reasons behind why the software is being developed,
and success definition.
Because of this alignment,
adding new features is easy,
and the understanding of the problem domain
stays in sync with the production code~\cite{millett_patterns_2015}.
A model of the solution is called the domain model.
The production code needs to directly reflect the domain model,
which means that \iac{UL},
a set of definitions
understood both by domain experts
and by developers~\cite{evans_domain-driven_2003,millett_patterns_2015},
has to be defined.
\Ac{UL} helps with confronting the proposed solutions
between these two groups.

I started tackling the problem domain by
laying out the high-level definitions
of all significant parts
that are necessary to implement the solution.
I wanted the domain of my application
to be as simple and clear as possible.
Therefore,
I came up with \iac{UL}
and defined four main components in the domain: Notification, Tag, App, and User.

\input{section/domain/notification.tex}
\input{section/domain/tag.tex}
\input{section/domain/app.tex}
\input{section/domain/user.tex}
