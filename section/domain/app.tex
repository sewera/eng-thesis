\subsection{App}\label{sec:app}

The App is able to send Notifications
in the domain.
Conceptually,
there is one instance of an App
per each real application
able to produce notifications.
Multiple Apps running on one producer scenario
is explained in detail in section~\ref{sec:producer-usage}.

For instance,
when I set up a health checking script
that produces a notification each time
a Systemd service is started,
like the one shown in listing~\ref{lst:sample-systemd-service-definition},
when any of the hooks fire,
and the notification arrives to the backend,
a new App is created in the domain.
When this happens,
a new App \ac{ID} is generated
and is later sent back to the producer.
