\subsection{App}\label{sec:app}

The App is able to send Notifications
in the domain.
Conceptually,
there is one instance of an App
per each real application
able to produce notifications.

For instance,
when I set up a health checking script
that produces a notification each time
a Systemd service is started,
like the one in listing~\ref{lst:sample-systemd-service-definition},
when any of the hooks fire,
and the notification arrives to the backend,
a new App is created in the domain.
When this happens,
a new App ID is generated
and is later sent back to the producer.
