\subsection{User}\label{sec:user}

The User is a recipient of Notifications.
Whenever a Notification
goes through the Tag a User is subscribed to,
they get this Notification.
The User is also responsible for
the deduplication of the Notifications,
should they arrive from multiple different Tags.
It is explained in detail in section~\ref{sec:tag-technicalities}.
