\subsection{Notification}\label{sec:notification}

The core of the application.
This is the structure
acting as a protocol of communication
between all components in the application domain.

It consists of the text fields,
like title, optional subtitle, optional body,
URIs for marking the Notification read,
but also an App\footnote{
  The app component is explained in detail in section~\ref{sec:app}
} of origin.

For the distributed nature of the components,
the Notification is always passed by value.
It is easily achieved
using the features of
the Go language\footnote{
  More on Go features in section~\ref{sec:the-benefits-of-using-go}
}.
