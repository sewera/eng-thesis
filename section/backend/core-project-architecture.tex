\subsection{Core project architecture}\label{core-project-architecture}

The project on the top-level is structured over 4 directories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
        \texttt{cmd} -- entry point to the application (\texttt{main})
  \item
        \texttt{internal} -- application-specific code
  \item
        \texttt{pkg} -- reusable utils, not specific to the application
  \item
        \texttt{test} -- black box integration test code
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{
  \texorpdfstring
  {The \textit{internal} directory}
  {The internal directory}
}\label{the-internal-directory}

Application-specific code is split into 5 directories
representing the levels of abstraction:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
        \texttt{domain} -- business logic,
        defines data structures and communication of domain objects
        on the highest level of abstraction,
  \item
        \texttt{grid} -- lower level of abstraction than domain,
        defines proxies that convert network models into domain models,
        creates and organizes domain objects into a grid,
        in which those objects can communicate,
  \item
        \texttt{impl} -- implements network endpoints,
        WebSockets, and persistence,
  \item
        \texttt{infra} -- configures the application
        and sets up the context for DI,
  \item
        \texttt{model} -- defines network data models.
\end{itemize}
