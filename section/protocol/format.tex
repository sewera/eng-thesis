\subsection{Format}\label{sec:protocol-format}

When I was choosing the right format
for the notifications,
I took into consideration two options:
binary and plain text.
I chose plain text,
because portability was very important to me.
I wanted to have the protocol able to run
between different processor architectures,
and not think about endianness.

Then, I wanted to use a format
that was popular for network data exchange.
The candidates were XML and JSON.
I really did not want to go with XML,
as the parsing is not that easy,
readability is very poor,
and the popularity is dropping
in favor of JSON.
So I chose JSON // TODO: finish
