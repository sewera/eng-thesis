\section{Protocol}\label{sec:protocol}

The Notification\footnote{
  The Notification is defined in section~\ref{sec:notification}.
} in the terms of a domain
was not suitable for the communication
between the producer, backend, and frontend.
That is why I specified a network protocol
for sending notifications
and replying with App \ac{ID} to a producer.
I needed to choose the right format
and develop a set of fields
containing all the useful information.
