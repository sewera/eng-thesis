\subsection{Fields}\label{sec:protocol-fields}

I created two versions of notification models.
One for the App,
and one for the client\footnote{
  A client is, e.g.,
  a browser tab running Notipie UI,
  and is represented
  by a User in the domain (section~\ref{sec:user}).
}.
They have a common subset of fields,
named \texttt{HashableNetNotification}.
\textit{Hashable} // TODO: finish
