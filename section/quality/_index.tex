\section{Quality}\label{sec:quality}

I want to take pride in what I do.
Therefore,
I took extra care when I created Notipie
to account for the quality of the product.
I defined the quality as follows:

\begin{quote}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sufficient product success,
    \item Sufficient product reliability, and
    \item Sufficient product maintainability and developer satisfaction.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

I also defined success as:

\begin{quote}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sufficient correctness of the delivered information,
    \item Sufficient usefulness of the delivered information, and
    \item Clear presentation of the information.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

I did not define success in the commercial terms,
because that was not the scope of my project.
I managed to keep my focus on quality,
and keep the list of features in check
by defining an MVP.
I also double-checked the correct behavior
of my application with manual E2E tests.
