\subsection{Minimum Viable Product}\label{sec:minimum-viable-product}

Eric Ries described the role of the \ac{MVP}
as a feedback of an idea~\cite{ries_lean_2011}.
Agile Alliance stressed the need
for the quality of that product~\cite{foster_mvp_2022}.
William S. Junk depicted the balance between
the schedule,
resources,
product features,
and quality~\cite{junk_dynamic_2000}.

I knew good quality not only is a requirement
to present the application to the potential users,
but also it reduces stress,
allows me to grow as a professional,
be proud of the work I did,
and prepare for the eventual extension
of the application~\cite{beck_extreme_2004,foster_mvp_2022,martin_clean_2011}.
I wanted my solution to be
as bug-free as possible.

Because of my limited schedule,
resources limited to only one programmer,
and the need for quality,
I did not want to go overboard
with excessive features.
The definition is as follows~\cite{sewera_mvp_2022}:

\begin{quote}
  Notifications can be sent with a manually programmed script
  with the help of a library.
  They arrive to the \ac{UI} in real time.

  The library is provided in the \ac{MVP}.\\
  The backend correctly forwards those notifications to the frontend.\\
  The backend stores existing notifications in memory.\\
  The frontend correctly presents notifications to the user.
\end{quote}
