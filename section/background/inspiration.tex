\subsection{Inspiration}\label{sec:backgroud-inspiration}

When I thought about easy-to-use,
standardized ways of displaying notifications,
I immediately looked at
the notification systems on smartphones.
Android and iOS have very simple,
yet very usable notifications,
that all go into a single place.

I wanted to have similar behavior
for my custom use cases,
without the need to install any apps
from the Apple AppStore,
or Google Play Store.
