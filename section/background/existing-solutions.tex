\subsection{Existing Solutions}\label{sec:existing-solutions}

There are many solutions
for systems monitoring,
there are e-mail filters
and smart directories,
even most modern operating systems have some kind of a notification center.

So why did I make Notipie in the first place?

First of all,
I needed something \emph{simple}.
I didn't want the hassle of setting up
the whole Grafana stack for my simple use case,
I also didn't want to go through the hoops
of setting an e-mail gate
for my server events and health checks.

I also considered IFTTT,
but the pricing~\cite{ifttt_plans_2022}
was too much for my simple usage,
and the built-in integrations
were not suited for my notification needs.
