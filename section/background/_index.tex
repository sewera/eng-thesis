\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

We get notifications every day.
Unfortunately,
those notifications either arrive
to our e-mail inboxes,
or worse,
we have to manually check
each and every website an event may have occurred on.

I personally use CI/CD pipelines
on Github Actions for my private projects,
and Jenkins for work.
I get loads of e-mail notifications from Icinga.
I check production servers' state on Grafana,
which also sends notifications
for severe events to my work Microsoft Teams.
I check the health of the services
running on my private server\footnote{
  An example of this particular use case
  is presented in appendix~\ref{apx:sample-systemd-service-with-notipie-hooks}.
} with a custom shell script.
The number of notifications I get every day
is usually too big to wrap my head around,
let alone the fact,
that they come from at least five different sources.

Notipie is a response to this problem.
It is specifically designed
to handle custom sources of notifications,
provide easy setup,
good performance,
and a simple interface.
