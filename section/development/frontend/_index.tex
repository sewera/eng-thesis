\subsection{Frontend}\label{sec:frontend}

The frontend's purpose is to present the data
it got from the backend to a user
in a manner that is both easy to read
and visually attractive.
If we take a look at the industry,
we can see that modern frontend applications
are expected to include
fast loading times,
asynchronous data fetching,
intuitive interface,
and~some~degree of familiarity,
which means they have to resemble
popular services to some extent.

When designing the \ac{UI} for Notipie,
I wanted not only to deliver great visual design,
but also intuitive user experience,
reliability,
and snappiness.
The front\-end code
can be found in the
\texttt{ui} directory of the Notipie project~\cite{sewera_notipie_2022-5}.
The \ac{UI} is available both in dark and light mode,
as shown in figures~\ref{fig:notipie-ui-dark}
and~\ref{fig:notipie-ui-light} respectively.
