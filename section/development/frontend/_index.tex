\subsection{Frontend}\label{sec:frontend}

The frontend's purpose is to present the data
it got from the backend to a user
in a manner that is both easy to read
and visually attractive.
Modern frontend applications
are expected to include
fast loading times,
asynchronous data fetching,
intuitive interface,
and some degree of familiarity,
which means they have to resemble
popular services to some extent.

When designing the \ac{UI} for Notipie,
I wanted not only to deliver great visual design,
but also intuitive user experience,
reliability,
and snappiness.
The frontend code
can be found in the
\texttt{ui} directory of the Notipie project~\cite{sewera_notipie_2022-5}.
The \ac{UI} is available both in dark and light mode,
as illustrated in figures~\ref{fig:notipie-ui-dark}
and~\ref{fig:notipie-ui-light} respectively.
