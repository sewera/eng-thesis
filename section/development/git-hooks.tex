\subsection{Git hooks}\label{sec:git-hooks}

Git hooks are a great tool
for enforcing common style guidelines,
commit message format,
and as a general reminder
to perform certain tasks before checking in the code.

From my professional experience,
git hooks have to be very quick,
preferably almost instant,
otherwise they will be skipped
with a \texttt{{-}{-}no-verify} flag.
At the beginning,
I have set up git hooks
with Husky~\cite{typicode_husky_2022},
but being written in JS,
they sometimes ran for over half a minute.
I decided to go with manually written shell scripts
as git hooks.
They turned out to be very performant,
easy to set up, and customize.
