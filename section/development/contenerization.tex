\subsection{Containerization}\label{sec:containerization}

To simplify the deployment process,
I decided to containerize my application
with Docker.
For the backend container,
I used different images
for building the binaries
and for running the service.
For the frontend container the approach was similar,
but for generating static files
and hosting them.

The setup is depicted in appendix~\ref{apx:containerization-with-docker}.
