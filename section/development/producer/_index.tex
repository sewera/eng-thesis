\section{Producer}\label{sec:producer}

The notification producer for Notipie
needed to be easy to use for developers
and system administrators.
Therefore,
I decided to provide both a Go library,
and a command line utility
that can easily be run on all major platforms
and operating systems.
The notification producer code
is in the
\texttt{producer} directory~\cite{sewera_notipie_2022-4}.
