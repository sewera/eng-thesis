\subsubsection{Go library}\label{sec:producer-go-library}

In order to make the notification producer
accessible to developers,
I created a~simple Go library
for easy notification creation and sending.
The library supports the basic operations
an App\footnote{
  The App is defined in section~\ref{sec:app}.
}, or rather its equivalent outside of the domain,
can~perform.
Those operations include pinging
the backend to check if it is up,
and pushing the notification to the backend.

The first operation is useful when setting up
a producer that can push to different backends,
depending on which one is up.
For example,
two backends are running
in two different VPNs.
Depending on which one of them
the computer producing notifications
is connected to,
it first pings those two,
and decides on which one to send the notification to.
This operation can be performed
when starting the producer up,
without the need to send a real notification.

Pushing the notification to the backend
also includes getting the App \ac{ID} from the backend.
The App \ac{ID} is generated whenever
a new App object in the domain is created
(section~\ref{sec:app}).
