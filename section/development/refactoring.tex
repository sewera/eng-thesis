\subsection{Go standard library exploration}

During this project,
I refactored my functions to better suit
the Go standard library.

For instance,
in commit \texttt{00547cd}\footfullcite{sewera_chorecoreproducer_2022},
I refactored the \texttt{ToJSON} method\footfullcite{sewera_tojson_2022}
to better suit the standard signatures,
i.e. to return the byte array, and error,
just like the \texttt{Marshal} method
from the \texttt{json} package~\cite{cox_json_2022}
in the standard library.
