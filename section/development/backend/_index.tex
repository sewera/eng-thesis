\subsection{Backend}\label{sec:backend}

The backend is a component in a system
that is responsible for the data processing.
It interacts with the frontend applications
with a well-known protocol,
usually one understood by a browser.

The backend of Notipie
needed to be performant,
easy to deploy,
and be of~good quality,
which means it has to be well-tested.
I strived to make use of the best practices
in the field of microservices,
maintain great quality,
and ensure sufficient performance.
I named it \textit{core},
because there can be different \acp{UI},
or notification producers,
but the core of Notipie
is specifically the backend implementation.
The backend code can be found in the
\texttt{core} directory of the Notipie project~\cite{sewera_notipie_2022}.
