\subsection{Backend}\label{sec:backend}

The backend is a component in a system
that is responsible for the data processing.
It interacts with the frontend applications
with a well-known protocol,
usually one understood by a browser.
Splitting the system into frontend and backend
enables easier reuse of the business logic,
and writing different frontend applications
that use the same backend.
Many huge organizations practice splitting
their systems into frontend and backend.
An example of this is Facebook,
which benefits from the ability to use
many different languages and libraries
that can interact between one another~\cite{abdullah_frontend_2014}.

The backend of Notipie
needed to be both performant,
easy to deploy,
and well-tested.
I strived to make use of the best practices
in the field of microservices,
maintain great quality,
and ensure sufficient performance.
I named it \textit{core},
because there can be different \acp{UI},
or notification producers,
but the entire application's core
is specifically the backend implementation.
The backend code
is in the
\texttt{core} directory~\cite{sewera_notipie_2022}.
