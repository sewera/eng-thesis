\section{Development}\label{sec:development}

The development process involved learning many practices
necessary to write a full-stack application.
One of them is splitting the system
into frontend and backend,
which enables easier reuse of the business logic
and writing different frontend applications
that use the same backend.
Many well-established organizations practice splitting
their systems into frontend and backend.
An example of this is Facebook,
which benefits from the ability to use
many different languages and libraries
that can interact between one another~\cite{abdullah_frontend_2014}.

In this section,
I will explain the development of every component
in the Notipie project, i.e.,
backend,
frontend, and
notification producer.
I will also elucidate the protocol
which is used for communication between aforementioned components,
and I will look into additional programming practices
I used during Notipie implementation.
