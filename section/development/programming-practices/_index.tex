\section{Programming Practices}\label{sec:programming-practices}

Programming is a very complex activity
in which an error can cause a hard to find bug
or prevent compilation altogether,
which in turn slows the development down.
To mitigate the risks of human error,
I used numerous programming practices
taken from \ac{XP}~\cite{beck_extreme_2004},
as well as personal and professional experience.
