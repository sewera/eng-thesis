\subsubsection{Continuous Integration}\label{sec:continuous-integration}

Following \ac{XP} practices,
I acknowledged the need for
continuous builds of my application~\cite{beck_extreme_2004},
so I decided to create a \ac{CI} pipeline.
I went with Github Actions~\cite{github_inc_github_2022-1},
because I have already had
the code repository in Github,
and it was easy to set up.

I also knew it has to satisfy
the ten-minute build constraint~\cite{beck_extreme_2004},
so I constantly made little changes
to make the build performant.
The biggest change to improve
the build time was to use caching.
For this task, I chose a first-party library,
Actions/Cache~\cite{sharma_actionscache_2022}
due to its integration with Github Actions.
I managed to optimize the build
from about 3.5 minutes
in the Notipie \ac{CI} run number 116~\footfullcite{sewera_notipie_2022-1}
to only 2 minutes after caching
in the run number 118~\footfullcite{sewera_notipie_2022-2}.
