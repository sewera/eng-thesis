\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

Notification management is a topic
that was tackled many times before.
There are more and less sophisticated
project for that,
and Notipie is one more example of them.

However,
with how simple it is to set up,
its simplicity and extendability,
I believe it has its place
in the vast field of
presenting just the right notifications
to its users.

The project itself presented a great opportunity
for exploration of different programming techniques,
experimentation with many approaches to common problems,
and even developing my own,
against what is the most popular in the industry.
In spite of project management
not being a task I anticipated
in a one-developer project,
I am very satisfied with the knowledge
I gained while managing myself.

I am very pleased with the TDD and DDD approaches.
I see them as extremely valuable
and I plan to use them extensively
from now on in my work.
I am very grateful for the insight
and experience of the authors of the books I read,
the blog posts I read,
and the free and open-source software
I used and studied.

I believe that Notipie has a huge potential
to be a successful solutions for many
notification management scenarios,
both commercially
and in terms of quality.
