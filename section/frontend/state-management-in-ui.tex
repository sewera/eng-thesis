\subsection{State management in UI}\label{state-management-in-ui}

To simplify the frontend code, I needed to use a single source of truth
for the data. I used both Redux\footnote{Redux, retrieved 2022-05-31.
\url{https://redux.js.org/}}, and Zustand\footnote{Zustand, retrieved
2022-05-31. \url{https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand}} for this task as
\emph{store} implementations, and Zustand came on top as a simpler
solution for my application.

\subsubsection{Redux}\label{redux}

Redux is great for big applications with lots of components. Being one
of the most popular state management libraries for React, it was my
first choice.

Unfortunately, it required me to write a lot of boilerplate code, and
thus was not easily maintainable for a smaller project like Notipie.

\subsubsection{Zustand}\label{zustand}

Zustand is a lot simpler than Redux, requires a lot less boilerplate
code, and was sufficient for my application. I migrated to it in commit
\texttt{7677d13}\footnote{commit \texttt{7677d13}, retrieved 2022-05-31.

and it reduced the lines of code by over 200. I did not however give up
the connected components, as they provide better testability and
separation of concerns, which is worth a bit extra code for that.
