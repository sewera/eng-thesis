\subsection{Build system}\label{build-system}

For the build and bundle software,
I wanted to use something modern,
with hot module reloading,
easy to use setup scripts,
customizable development server,
and short bundle times.

\subsubsection{Snowpack and Vite}\label{snowpack-and-vite}

I started with Snowpack~\cite{schott_snowpack_2021}
and used it until I decided to move to Vite~\cite{you_vite_2022}
in commit \texttt{c11bc35}\footnote{
  commit \texttt{c11bc35}, 2021.
    [Online]. (visited on 2022-05-31).

}.

Snowpack offered both hot module reloading and short bundle times,
however, there were some minor problems from time to time, the project
had a slow development, and the alternative, Vite did not seem to have
those problems.

I tried Vite in my other project, Reactive Raven\footnote{Reactive

integration with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other tools I used
was seamless, therefore I decided to migrate to it in Notipie as well.

On April 20th, 2022, Snowpack's maintainer stated in the project's
Readme document (commit \texttt{45456aa})\footnote{project's Readme

that they would no longer maintain the project and mentioned Vite as a
good alternative for it.
