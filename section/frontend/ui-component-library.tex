\subsection{UI component library}\label{ui-component-library}

When choosing the library for the UI components, I considered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
        React~\cite{oshannessy_react_2022},
  \item
        Vue.js~\cite{you_vuejs_2022}, and
  \item
        Angular~\cite{kalpakas_angular_2022}.
\end{itemize}

All those libraries are very popular,
so I chose React,
because I had the most experience with it in my professional work.
