\subsection{UI component library}\label{ui-component-library}

When choosing the library for the UI components, I considered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    React\footnote{React, retrieved 2022-05-31. \url{https://reactjs.org/}},
  \item
    Vue.js\footnote{Vue.js, retrieved 2022-05-31. \url{https://vuejs.org/}},
    and
  \item
    Angular\footnote{Angular, retrieved 2022-05-31.
    \url{https://angular.io/}}.
\end{itemize}

All those libraries are very popular, so I chose React, because I had
the most experience with it in my professional work.
