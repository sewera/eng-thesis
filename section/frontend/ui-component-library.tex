\subsection{UI component library}\label{sec:ui-component-library}

When choosing the library for the UI components, I considered:

\begin{itemize}
      \item
            React~\cite{oshannessy_react_2022},
      \item
            Vue.js~\cite{you_vuejs_2022}, and
      \item
            Angular~\cite{kalpakas_angular_2022}.
\end{itemize}

All those libraries are very popular,
so I chose React,
because I had the most experience with it in my professional work.
