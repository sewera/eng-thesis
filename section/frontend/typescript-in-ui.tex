\subsection{TypeScript in UI}\label{typescript-in-ui}

I decided to use TypeScript in my project for the frontend part because
of its type checking tools, huge popularity, and a growing demand for in
on the job market.

\subsubsection{Choosing the language}\label{choosing-the-language}

When choosing which language to use in the UI, I considered a couple of
options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    plain JavaScript,
  \item
    TypeScript,
  \item
    Elm, and
  \item
    CoffeeScript.
\end{itemize}

I immediately discarded the last two, due to their smaller popularity
compared to JavaScript or TypeScript.

The featureset of the language was also very important to me. JavaScript
is by far the most popular, but it lacks type annotations or pre-runtime
type checking. TypeScript and Elm turned out to be winners in the type
checking toolchain.

TypeScript also has a big advantage of being very similar to plain
JavaScript, so the transpiled code is very readable.

A big factor was general trend of language's popularity growth.
TypeScript was a clear winner in this scenario, being third most loved
language and second most wanted language in the Stack Overflow Developer
Survey 2021\footnote{Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021, retrieved
2022-05-31.
\url{https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021\#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-want}}.
It was only beaten by Rust and Clojure in the \emph{Most Loved} section,
both of which are non-frontend languages, and Python in the \emph{Most
Wanted} section, which is also not a frontend language.

Another report confirming the growing popularity of TypeScript is Github
Octoverse Report 2021\footnote{Github Octoverse Report 2021, retrieved
2022-05-31.
\url{https://octoverse.github.com/\#top-languages-over-the-years}}.
Since 2017 it beat Ruby, C, C++, C\#, Shell, and PHP and is, as of 2021,
fourth top language on Github.

\subsubsection{Working with TypeScript}\label{working-with-typescript}

Starting with TypeScript was fairly easy, the toolchain was included in
the project creation scripts. Most dependencies had good TypeScript
annotations, or they were completely written in TypeScript, which was
very helpful for maintaining type safety.

Learning the language was also very easy. I was already familiar with
JavaScript, so I only needed to learn the type annotations, which were
very intuitive to use.
