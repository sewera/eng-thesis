\subsection{Project board}\label{project-board}

One of the great tools that helped with the project management
was the new Github Project board,
which is currently in beta~\cite{github_github_2022}.
The Kanban board~\cite{goddard_kanban_2022} consists of four sections (columns):

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textit{Todo},
  \item
    \textit{Open},
  \item
    \textit{In Progress}, and
  \item
    \textit{Done}.
\end{itemize}

Section \textit{Todo} consists of all the issues
connected to this project
that are planned to be worked on in the future.

Section \textit{Open} consists of issues
that need to be worked on next.
Those are usually one to three issues
that need to be done in a certain order.

Section \textit{In Progress} contains issues
that are currently being worked on.
There is usually only one issue in this column.

Section \textit{Done} consists of all the finished issues,
as well as the issues that were decided to be unnecessary.
In that case, the issues are marked with a \texttt{wontfix} label.
