\subsection{Product development}\label{sec:product-development}

The most important thing
I learned in the field of project management
was undoubtedly how to reliably conduct product development.
When I started devel\-oping Notipie,
I had a very vague vision
of what the finished product will provide.
The essential functionality was interleaved with features
that could not be implemented without the essentials.

That is when I decided to streamline the development
and set a constraint of what needs to be done
in order to consider the product usable.
I defined the \textbf{\acf{MVP}}.
I also prioritized the issues
based on that \ac{MVP}~\cite{sewera_issues_2022}.
More on this topic in section~\ref{sec:minimum-viable-product}.
