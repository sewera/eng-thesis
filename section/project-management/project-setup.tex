\subsection{Project setup}\label{sec:project-setup}

Before starting a project,
we know the least about it.
We do not want to make the least decisions
at this point~\cite{beck_extreme_2004}.
The things most susceptible to change
should be considered to be changed in the future.
It is of utmost importance to capture
the essence of the problem.
Domain-Driven Design helps with
gathering this essence,
which is called
the core domain~\cite[Part~I, Chapter~3]{millett_patterns_2015}.
The domain of Notipie is described in detail
in section~\ref{sec:domain}.

On the other hand,
we have to be aware that our application
may not be suitable for DDD patterns.
I also took care for the simplicity
of every aspect of my application,
so that when I sat to read the code
I wrote six months before,
I was able to understand it
within a reasonable time.
