\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

We get notifications every day.
Unfortunately,
those notifications either arrive
to our e-mail inboxes,
or worse,
we have to manually check
each and every website an event may have occurred on.

I personally use \ac{CI} -- \ac{CD} pipelines
on Github Actions for my private projects,
and Jenkins for work.
I get loads of e-mail notifications from Icinga.
I check production servers' state on Grafana,
I check the notifications sent to my work Microsoft Teams,
I check the health of the services
running on my private server\footnote{
  An example of this particular use case
  is presented in appendix~\ref{apx:sample-systemd-service-with-notipie-hooks}.
} with a custom shell script.
The number of notifications I get every day
is usually too big to wrap my head around,
let alone the fact,
that they come from at least five different sources.

Notipie is a response to this problem.
It is specifically designed
to handle custom sources of notifications,
provide easy setup,
good performance,
and a simple interface.
The project's source code can be found
on Github: \url{https://github.com/blazejsewera/notipie}.

In the next section,
section~\ref{sec:domain},
I will demonstrate my solution
by explaining the problem domain in detail,
and providing necessary definitions.
In section~\ref{sec:project-management},
I will go through
the project management
to show how this project was conducted,
as well as which tools and practices
I used to achieve my goal.
Section~\ref{sec:development}
will outline the process of implementing
each component in the system,
describe the protocol for communication
between those components,
and talk about the programming practices I used.
In section~\ref{sec:quality},
I will describe how I ensured
good product quality,
and my approach to testing.
Section~\ref{sec:takeaways}
will lay out the takeaways from the development
of this project.
I will show what went right
and what I wish I had done differently.
