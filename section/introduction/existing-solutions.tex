\subsection{Existing Solutions}\label{sec:existing-solutions}

There are many solutions
for systems monitoring,
there are e-mail filters
and smart directories.
Most modern operating systems have some kind of a notification center.
So why did I make Notipie in the first place?

First of all,
I needed something \emph{simple}.
I didn't want the hassle of setting up
the whole Grafana stack for my simple use case,
I also didn't want to go through the trouble
of setting an e-mail gate
for my server events and health checks.
I~also~considered IFTTT,
but the pricing~\cite{ifttt_plans_2022}
was too much for my simple usage,
and the built-in integrations
were not suited for my notification needs.

When I thought about easy-to-use,
standardized ways of displaying notifications,
I immediately looked at
the notification systems on smartphones.
Android and iOS have very simple,
yet very usable notifications,
that all go into a single place.
I wanted to have similar behavior
for my custom use cases,
without the need to~install any apps
from the Apple AppStore,
or Google Play Store.
