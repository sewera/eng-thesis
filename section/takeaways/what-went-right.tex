\subsection{What went right}\label{sec:what-went-right}

The thing I am most satisfied with
is the lack of the database.
It was not dictated by my reluctancy to add one,
but rather an informed decision
to postpone the whole database setup,
and not include it in an MVP.

I set up a CI pipeline
in Github Actions~\cite{github_inc_github_2022-1}
pretty early in the project,
before I even read how important it is
from Kent Beck~\cite{beck_extreme_2004}.

As I was writing the core domain code,
I followed another Kent Beck's advice,
and I left breaking tests between commits.
It was an advice for one-developer projects
utilizing TDD~\cite{beck_test-driven_2002}.

I am very proud of my experiments
on the code,
like Reactive Raven~\cite{sewera_reactive_2022},
explained in section~\ref{sec:reactive-raven},
or connecting snapshot testing
with a CSS utility library
to avoid slow visual tests,
which is explained in section~\ref{sec:ui-testing}.
