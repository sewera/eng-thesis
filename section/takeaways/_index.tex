\section{Takeaways}\label{sec:takeaways}

The main goal of this project
was to learn as much as possible about
frontend and backend development,
testing,
UI design, and
project management,
as well as grow as a professional,
evaluate best practices,
and gain experience.
I am proud of what I did right,
and satisfied with the lessons
I have got from what I did wrong.
