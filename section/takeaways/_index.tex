\section{Takeaways}\label{sec:takeaways}

The main goal of this project
was to learn as much as possible about
frontend and backend development,
testing,
\ac{UI} design, and
project management.
I achieved much more than that.
This project enabled me to grow as a professional,
evaluate best practices,
and gain experience.
I am proud of what I did right,
and satisfied with the lessons
I received as a result of reflecting on my mistakes.
