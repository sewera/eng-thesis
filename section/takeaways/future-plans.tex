\subsection{Future plans}\label{sec:future-plans}

The project achieved its \ac{MVP} state.
Nevertheless, I want to continue the development,
integrating the most common services
with Notipie.
This means writing simple,
application-specific producers.
I want to base those producers on Webhooks~\cite{lindsay_web_2007},
because they are widespread
and available in most of the services
I want to integrate with.
I am very happy with the producer library I wrote,
so the development should be easy enough.

The further road map would be
incorporating user authentication in the app,
creating a search view for the notifications,
enabling users to assign the Tags to Apps
directly in the \ac{UI},
implementing a custom urgency association system
based on user-defined rules,
and setting up a robust database.

The \ac{MVP} enables me to evaluate the idea itself,
present the current implementation to potential users,
and gather their opinions and feelings about the product.
I also can research the needs of those users,
and decide what should be implemented next.

The best practices I used make those changes
fairly easy.
The code has a good structure,
is easy to understand,
and is well-tested.
I am positive all of that contributes
to an excellent project
with lots of potential.
I strongly believe in
free and open-source software,
and I even see a commercial use of it.
