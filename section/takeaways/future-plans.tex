\subsection{Future plans}\label{sec:future-plans}

After the project achieved its \ac{MVP} state,
I want to continue the development,
integrating the most common services
with Notipie.
This means writing simple,
application-specific producers.
I am very happy with the producer library I wrote,
so the development should be easy enough.

The further road map would be
incorporating user authentication in the app,
creating a search view for the notifications,
enabling users to assign the Tags to Apps
directly in the \ac{UI},
implementing a custom urgency association system
based on user-defined rules,
and setting up a robust database.

The \ac{MVP} enables me to evaluate the idea itself,
present the current implementation to potential users,
gather the information on what are the needs
of those users,
and decide what should be implemented next.

The best practices I used make those changes
fairly easy.
The code is well-factored,
easy to understand,
and well-tested.
I think all of that contributes
to an excellent project
with lots of potential.
I strongly believe in
free and open-source software,
and I see even commercial use of it.
