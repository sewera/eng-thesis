\subsection{What went wrong}\label{sec:what-went-wrong}

Or rather,
what I wish I have had experience with
before I developed Notipie.

I definitely would like to have another developer
on the project.
\citetitle{beck_extreme_2004}~\cite{beck_extreme_2004}
really underlines the importance of pair programming
and code review process.
After working professionally as a developer,
I can see why.
Code review was simply out of reach for this project,
as I was the only developer in it.

I was very excited to try the
DDD layered structure~\cite{evans_domain-driven_2003}
right from the start.
I wish I kept the project as simple as possible,
started with simple endpoints
and small initial architecture.
Then, when refactoring,
I could gain more experience
with incremental design~\cite{fowler_refactoring_2019,beck_extreme_2004},
make better decisions about the application structure,
and possibly have a working product sooner.
